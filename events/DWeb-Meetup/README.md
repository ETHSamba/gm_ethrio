# This file is a template to create new events. In order to use it, duplicate
# the whole folder (/template) as a new folder (I.E. /my-event-name) inside of
# the /events folder, using for the folder name _only_:
# - lowercase letters
# - hyphens/dashes (-) instead of spaces
# - alphanumeric characters ('a' to 'z', '0' to '9')
# and edit the README.md file inside that new folder just created.
#
# The name of the folder will be used on the URL. Example:
# https://blockchainweek.berlin/my-event-name
#
# _Don't_ rename the new file (README.md), only edit its content.
# _Don't_ remove any text before the colons at the beginning of each line,
# only edit what is after the colon. Example:
# Don't remove the word nor colon on 'description:'
#
# Every line starting with a hash symbol (#) is a comment. It will be ignored
# and can be safely removed, including these instructions.

synopsis:
  - After a bit of COVID hibernation, I would like to restart DWeb Prague meetups a bit. With the upcoming ETHPrague there will be a lot of interesting people coming to the town, one of them is Vojtech Simetka from Swarm Foundation, which develop a decentralized storage protocol Swarm that has very tight roots with Ethereum itself. He will give a talk about "Decentralised Storage, Swarm and Web 3.0". The talk will be in English.
  - There will be pizza and beverages provided thanks to the generous support from Swarm Foundation. After the talk, there will be an unofficial sit-down with several members from the Swarm Foundation in some pub nearby.
  - The talk abstract
  - Over the past few years, a lot of the data on the internet has moved from self-hosted servers into cloud storage. Chances are, most of the services you use daily, store your data in data centers owned by Amazon, Apple, Google, or Microsoft. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts surely heard the phrase "not your keys, not your coins". We'd like to extend to "not your storage, not your data". The Web 3.0 movement is trying to change this. By storing our data in decentralized storage we can reduce the risk of losing access to them (e.g. through de-platforming or censorship) and it allows new economic models around data ownership. In this talk, we will explain what is decentralised storage, explain how the Swarm networks work, and what is Web 3.0.
